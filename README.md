### Record Break

Record Break is a personalized online music database that is in development.

Record Break will allow users to register and keep an inventory of their physical music collection (CD/tape/vinyl).

Developed using a Ruby back-end and HTML/CSS/Javascript for the front-end. 

As of now, as user can create an account and log in with the ability to add an album to their collection. Future developments will allow for a more comprehensive database as well as the ability for users to add/edit information for the site itself.
